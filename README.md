# Config Files and Settings for Linux - Mainly Ubuntu

These files are some settings that I Picked up, along the way of using shell and tools like Git and Vim.

You are free to use this, However you like.

# Installation

Initialize a git repo in Home Directory

`cd ~`

`git init`

Now Pull from the repo url to the new repo
